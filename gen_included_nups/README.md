### This directory contains code to determine which nup combinations will be used to generate snapshot models.
Structural sampling is performed on the snapshot models selected by this script, 
which are determined to be the most likely copy numbers based on FCS data.

#### gen_top_comp_library.py - Script that determines which nup compositions are good scoring, and generates files to prepare these simulations for structural sampling
