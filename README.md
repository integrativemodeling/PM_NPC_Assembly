The code is divided into directories. They are referenced in order of the steps necessary to create the model of NPC assembly:
1. data - ...
2. align_npc - ...
3. included_nups - ...
4. start_sim - ...
5. tools - ...
6. refine_sim - Code to run refinement simulations of snapshot models.
7. score_graph - Code to score spatiotemporal models from a series of snapshot models.
8. analysis - Code to analyze the spatiotemporal model of NPC assembly and the snapshot models along the pathway.
