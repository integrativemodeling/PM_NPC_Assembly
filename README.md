The code is divided into directories. Here, they are referenced in order of the steps necessary to create the model of NPC assembly:
1. data - Input information for the NPC assembly model and code for pre-processing that information.
2. align_npc - Code for the aligning the mature NPC structure to time-dependent ET maps.
3. included_nups - Code to determine which nup combinations will be used to generate snapshot models.
4. start_sim - Code to run initial simulations of snapshot models.
5. tools - Code for the scoring function of snapshot models.
6. refine_sim - Code to run refinement simulations of snapshot models.
7. score_graph - Code to score spatiotemporal models from a series of snapshot models.
8. analysis - Code to analyze the spatiotemporal model of NPC assembly and the snapshot models along the pathway.

The Zenodo version of this respository (XXX) also includes the model, in the simulations_round2 directory
